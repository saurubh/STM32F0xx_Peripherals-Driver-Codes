	GPIO IO Toggle example

	Example Description 

GPIO ports are connected on AHB bus, using BSRR and BRR registers two cycles are
required to set a pin and another two cycles to reset it. So GPIO pins can toggle
at AHB clock divided by 4.

This example describes how to use BSRR and BRR (Port Bit Set/Reset Register High 
and Low) for maximum IO toggling.

PC10 and PC11 when using the STM320518-EVAL (configured in output pushpull mode)
toggles in a forever loop:
 - Set PC10 and PC11 by setting corresponding bits in BSRR register
 - Reset PC10 and PC11 by setting corresponding bits in BRR register

In this example, HCLK is configured at 48 MHz so PC10 and PC11 toggles at 12MHz.
To achieve the maximum IO toggling frequency, you have to configure your compiler
options for high speed optimization.

	Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM320518-EVAL (STM32F0xx)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.


	How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F0xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
