	ADC_DMA Example Description

	Example Description 

This example describes how to use the ADC1 and DMA to transfer continuously 
converted data from ADC1 to memory.
The ADC1 is configured to convert continuously channel11, Voltage reference, 
Temperature sensor and Battery charge.
Each time an end of conversion occurs the DMA transfers, in circular mode, the
converted data from ADC1 DR register to the RegularConvData_Tab[4] table.
User can vary the ADC1 channel11 voltage using the EVAL Board potentiometer RV3.
The 4 converted voltages are displayed on the EVAL Board LCD.

	ADC LowPower Example 

	Example Description 

This example provides a short description of how to use the ADC peripheral with 
Auto-delayed conversion mode and Auto-poweroff modes.

The ADC is triggered by TIM3_TRGO which is connected to TIM3_Update Event.
Each time the ADC is triggered, it converts the RV3 voltage (which correspond to
ADC channel11), and then the ADC enter in delay mode (no Overrun detect) until the
ADC data register has been read by pressing KEY button 

To active the Auto delay mode and also the Auto power off mode uncomment  "#define ADC_LOWPOWER ".
If "#define ADC_LOWPOWER" is commented the, an overrun interrupt is generated and
LED1 is toggled. Otherwise, LED1 remain OFF.

	ADC1 AnalogWatchdog Example

	Example Description 

This example describes how to use the ADC analog watchdog to guard continuously  
an ADC channel.
The ADC1 is configured to convert continuously ADC channel11 
The analog watchdog is configured and enabled to guard a single regular channel.
Each time the channel11 converted value exceeds programmed analog watchdog high 
threshold (value 3102) or goes down analog watchdog low threshold (value 1861)
an AWD interrupt is generated and the output pin connected to LED4 is toggled. The
LED will bright as long as the AWD interrupt is generated which means that the 
converted value of regular ADC channel11 is outside the range limited by high and 
low analog watchdog thresholds.

 note that ADC channel11 is connected to a potentiometer (RV3) which can deliver 
a voltage between 0V and 3.3V.

	Battery Charge Monitoring ADC Example

	Example Description 

This example describes how to measure VBAT voltage using ADC1 regular channel 18.
In fact, the measured value correspond to VBAT/2; as the VBAT voltage could be higher
than VDDA, to ensure the correct operation of the ADC, the VBAT pin is internally
connected to a bridge divider by 2.

User can display the VBAT voltage on the EVAL Board LCD
